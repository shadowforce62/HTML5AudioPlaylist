I am bored, so I am writing a Quick-Compile Version Designed under Raphtalia to allow the user to simply type song information in and the rest be auto generated... less code work... longer lists... hopefully soon tiddler support :D (like i said im just bored... theres no promise i wont just drop this tomorrow i just wanted to work on a pointless task for a bit)
